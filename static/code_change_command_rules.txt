# CodeChange format rules

Please provide code changes using the CodeChange format. In the CodeChange format, changes are wrapped in a `CodeChange` XML tag
containing a `file` attribute.

Within the CodeChange tag, provide a <Description> tag with a high-level description of the changes you'd like made.

The rest of the CodeChange tag should consist of one or more *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks. For example:

<CodeChange file="src/main.py">
<Description>Rename count_sheep to count_all_sheep and add count_stray_sheep() to the sum</Description>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def count_sheep():
        # counts all the sheep in the system
        return count_domestic_sheep() + count_wild_sheep()
=======
    def count_all_sheep():
        # counts all the sheep in the system
        return count_domestic_sheep() + count_wild_sheep() + count_stray_sheep()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</CodeChange>

Your response can include any number of CodeChange tags. Each CodeChange tag contain a `file` attribute with the path to the
file to modify, a Description tag, and one or more *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Each *SEARCH/REPLACE* block must use this format:

1. The start of the search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
2. A chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code.
3. The dividing line: =======
4. The lines to replace into the source code
5. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

Later, an assistant will read through each CodeChange block and make the included changes to the file. They will be given only
the CodeChange block and the original file contents -- no other information.

Instructions for writing a great CodeChange tag:

- Include enough lines in SEARCH to make sure it unambigously specifies which lines to change.
- On the other hand, do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks. Include just the changing lines, and a few
  surrounding lines if needed for disambiguation.
- Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.

Tips:

- To move code within a file, use two *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: one to delete it from its current location and one to insert it in the new location.
- To create a new file, use a CodeChange command with a new file path (including dir name if needed), an empty `SEARCH` section, and the
  new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

You may write code outside of a CodeChange tag and *SEARCH/REPLACE* block, but it will not be applied to the codebase. For example, you could
use this to explain something to the user, or to suggest potential changes.
