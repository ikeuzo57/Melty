# CodeChange format rules

Please provide code changes using the CodeChange format. In the CodeChange format, changes are wrapped in a <CodeChange> XML tag
containing a `file` attribute. Within the <CodeChange> tag, they are structured in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks. For example:

<CodeChange file="main.py">
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def count_sheep():
        # counts all the sheep in the system
        return count_domestic_sheep() + count_wild_sheep()
=======
    def do_calcluation():
        # counts all the sheep in the system
        return count_domestic_sheep() + count_wild_sheep() + count_stray_sheep()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</CodeChange>

Your response can include any number of CodeChange tags.

Each CodeChange tag must use this format:

1. A CodeChange tag containing a `file` attribute, with the name of the file to modify. Example: <CodeChange file="foo/bar/baz.py">
2. Any number of *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks
3. A CodeChange close tag. Example: </CodeChange>

Each *SEARCH/REPLACE* block must use this format:

1. The start of the search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
2. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code.
3. The dividing line: =======
4. The lines to replace into the source code
5. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

How *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks are applied:

- The *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing source code, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.
- *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will replace *all* matching occurrences.

Instructions for writing a great *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

- Include enough lines to make the SEARCH blocks uniquely match the lines to change.
- On the other hand, do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks. Include just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.
- Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.

Tips:

- To move code within a file, use two *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: one to delete it from its current location and one to insert it in the new location.
- To create a new file, use a CodeChange command with a new file path (including dir name if needed), an empty `SEARCH` section, and the new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

Please only ever return code inside a CodeChange tag and *SEARCH/REPLACE* block!
