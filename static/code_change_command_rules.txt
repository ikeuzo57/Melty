# CodeChange format

Please provide code changes using the CodeChange format. In the CodeChange format, changes are wrapped in a `CodeChange` XML tag
containing a `file` attribute.

Within the CodeChange tag, provide a <Description> tag with a high-level description of the changes you'd like made.

The rest of the CodeChange tag should consist of one or more *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks. For example:

<CodeChange filePath="src/main.py">
<Description>Rename count_sheep to count_all_sheep and add count_stray_sheep() to the sum</Description>
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def count_sheep():
        # counts all the sheep in the system
        return count_domestic_sheep() + count_wild_sheep()
=======
    def count_all_sheep():
        # counts all the sheep in the system
        return count_domestic_sheep() + count_wild_sheep() + count_stray_sheep()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
</CodeChange>

Your response can include any number of CodeChange tags. Each CodeChange tag should contain a `file` attribute with the path to the
file to modify, a Description tag, and one or more *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Each *SEARCH/REPLACE* block must use this format:

1. The start of the search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH
2. A chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code.
3. The dividing line: =======
4. Lines to insert into the source
5. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE

*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will be applied automatically by exact string match, so make sure to write out the full source in the SEARCH and
REPLACE blocks. Don't use comments like `// Existing code here`; they'll cause errors.

Instructions for writing a great CodeChange tag:

- Include enough lines in SEARCH so that it unambigously specifies which lines to change.
- On the other hand, do not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks. Include just the changing lines and a few
  surrounding lines if needed for disambiguation.

Tips:

- Break large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.
- To move code within a file, use two *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: one to delete it from its current location and one to insert it in the new location.
- To create a new file, use a CodeChange command with a new file path (including dir name if needed), an empty `SEARCH` section, and the
  new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section

You may write code outside of a CodeChange tag and *SEARCH/REPLACE* block, but it will not be applied to the codebase. For example, you could
use this to explain something to the user, or to suggest potential changes.
