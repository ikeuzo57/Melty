# Melty, an open source AI code editor for 10x engineers

[Melty](https://melty.sh) is the first AI code editor that's aware of what you're doing from the terminal to GitHub, and collaborates with you to write production-ready code.

## Meet Melty

We're Charlie and Jackson. We're longtime friends who met playing ultimate frisbee at Brown.

[Charlie](http://charlieholtz.com) comes from [Replicate](https://replicate.com/), where he started the Hacker in Residence team and [accidentally struck fear into the heart of Hollywood](https://www.businessinsider.com/david-attenborough-ai-video-hollywood-actors-afraid-sag-aftra-2023-11). [Jackson](http://jdecampos.com) comes from Netflix, where he [built machine learning infrastructure](https://netflixtechblog.com/scaling-media-machine-learning-at-netflix-f19b400243) that picks the artwork you see for your favorite shows.

We've used most of the AI coding tools out there, and often ended up copy–pasting code, juggling ten chats for the same task, or committing buggy code that came back to bite us later. AI has already transformed how we code, but we know it can do a lot more.

**So we're building Melty, the first AI code editor that can make big changes across multiple files and integrate with your entire workflow.**

We've been building Melty for 28 days, and it's already writing about half of its own code. Melty can…

We're designing Melty to:

- Help you understand your code better, not worse
- Watch every change you make, like a pair programmer
- Learn and adapt to your codebase
- Integrate with your compiler, terminal, and debugger, as well as tools like Linear and GitHub
